 *2.4.1*


2.4.1 (Jan. 22, 2015)
=====================

Install:
   - Fixed unattended installation.
Eclim:
   - Updated the search behavior across all eclim's supported
     languages to now use vim's quickfix list instead of the location
     list, and to only do so if there is more than one result.
   - Updated eclim's sign support for quickfix results to now be
     disabled by default.
   - Updated eclim's signs to use more unique ids to support
     multiple different sign types on a single line and to avoid
     clashing with other plugins that may be setting signs on the same
     lines as eclim.
Project:
   - Added a |:ProjectRun| command to invoke your project's eclipse
     run configuration.  Thanks to Daniel Leong
   - Added |:ProjectImportDiscover| to bulk import projects from a
     common parent directory.  Thanks to Kannan Rajah
Java:
   - Added support for java debugging (vim-java-debug).  Thanks to
     Kannan Rajah
   - Added a |:JavaNew| command to create new classes, interfaces,
     etc in your project.  Thanks to Daniel Leong
   - Added ability to configure :JavaImpl to insert methods at the
     current cursor position (|g:EclimJavaImplInsertAtCursor|). Thanks
     to Daniel Leong
   - Updated :JavaSearch to support sorting
     (vim-java-search#org-eclim-java-search-sort) the results by
     relative path.  Thanks to Kannan Rajah
Groovy:
   - Added support for groovy validation (vim-groovy-validate) and
     code completion (vim-groovy-complete).  Thanks to Yves Zoundi
Python:
   - Fixed eclim's python support to work against the pydev 3.9.1
Scala:
   - Scala support has been re-enabled now that ScalaIDE 4.0.0 for
     Luna has been released.
   Git Log (2.4.1) (https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/compare/2.4.0...2.4.1)
 *2.4.0*


2.4.0 (Aug. 24, 2014)
=====================

Eclim:
   - Eclim now supports, and requires, Eclipse Luna
   - :EclimSettings renamed to :WorkspaceSettings to better reflect
     what is being edited.
   - Added :VimSettings (|vim-core-eclim#:VimSettings|) command to
     make viewing/editing of eclim's vim client settings easier.
   - All eclim make based commands (:Ant, :Mvn, etc.) will now use
     dispatch (https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) if available. If
     you would like to disable this behavior, add the following to
     your vimrc:
     >
        let g:EclimMakeDispatchEnabled = 0

     <

   - Lot of bugs have also been fixed.
Scala:
   - Scala support is disabled in this release. I tried waiting for
     a final release of ScalaIDE 4.0.0 for Luna, but I don't want to
     hold up the rest of eclim any longer. If you want to use eclim's
     scala support, you'll need to install the ScalaIDE 4.0.0
     milestone and build eclim from the master git branch.

=====================

Java:
   - Fixed possible infinite loop when adding imports using
     :JavaImport.
   - Fixed an edge case which caused an additional empty line to be
     added between imports that should be grouped together when using
     :JavaImport.
   - Fixed :Java command if the main class has no package
     declaration.
   - Fixed issue with large portions of code being re-formatted when
     applying a correction suggestion.
   - TODO/FIXME markers are now ignored by validation.
   - Some of the eclipse java code completion settings are now

     rope.

       <


Scala:
   - Disabled use of temp files which could cause some validation
     errors.

   Git Log (2.3.3) (https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/compare/2.3.2...2.3.3)
 *2.3.2* *1.7.18*


2.3.2 / 1.7.18 (Sep. 12, 2013)
==============================

Installer:
   - Fixed extraction of scala vim files when installing scala
     support.
Php:
   - Fixed completion of php namespaces.
   Git Log (2.3.2) (https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/compare/2.3.1...2.3.2)
   Git Log (1.7.18) (https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/compare/1.7.17...1.7.18)
 *2.3.1*


2.3.1 (Jul. 27, 2013)
=====================

Installer:
   - Fixed dependencies to point at the Kepler update site.
   Git Log (2.3.1) (https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/compare/2.3.0...2.3.1)
 *2.3.0* *1.7.17*


2.3.0 / 1.7.17 (Jul. 21, 2013)
==============================

Java:
   - :NewJarEntry (|:NewJarEntry_java|) now accepts up to 3
     arguments allowing you to create the jar entry with the path to
     the jar, path to the source, and the path to the javadocs.
   - On javadoc search, all results, including results found in jar
     files, will be fully translated to usable urls to be opened by
     vim instead of sending jar results back to eclipse to let it open
     them. With this change your chosen brower on the vim side will
     always be used.
   - Fix for import grouping by package on Kepler.
Php:
   Warning: Reminder: The format of the h2 database used for php
     searching and code completion has changed in Kepler which may
     result in searching / code completion not returning any results,
     both in eclim and in the standard eclipse php editor.  To fix
     this you'll need to stop eclipse, remove the old index, and then
     restart:>

        $ rm -r <your workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.core.index.sql.h2/

     <


Scala:
   - Updated to require 3.0.1 of the Scala IDE which now supports
     Kepler (for eclim 2.3.0 only). Since this version of the Scala
     IDE seems to only support Scala 2.10.x now, the option to install
     2.9.x version has been removed, however the indigo release of
     eclim (1.7.17) still supports the Scala 2.9.x version of Scala
     IDE 3.0.0.
Xml:
   - |:XmlFormat| now uses the DOM3 APIs to improve the formatted
     result, honoring your textwidth and indent settings.

   Git Log (1.7.17) (https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/compare/1.7.16...1.7.17)
 *2.2.7* *1.7.16*


2.2.7 / 1.7.16 (Jul. 14, 2013)
==============================

Java:
   - Fix for some completions on Kepler.
   - Fix for rare case where an invalid classpath entry could result
     in the .classpath file reverted to the eclipse default.
   - |:JavaCallHierarchy| added to show the caller or callee
     hierarchy of a method.  Thanks to Alexandre Fonseca
Php:
   Warning: The format of the h2 database used for php searching and
     code completion has changed in Kepler which may result in
     searching / code completion not returning any results, both in
     eclim and in the standard eclipse php editor. To fix this you'll
     need to stop eclipse, remove the old index, and then restart:>

        $ rm -r <your workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.core.index.sql.h2/

Ruby:
   - Fixed the inserted completion text for some ruby libraries.
Scala:
   - The graphical installer now includes a compiled eclim sdt
     bundle for both scala 2.9.x and 2.10.x for which one will be
     chosen for you if you already have the scala-ide installed,
     otherwise you can pick one and the appropriate version of the
     scala-ide will be installed for you.
Vimplugin:
   - The option to force focusing of gvim with a simulated click is
     now disabled by default, but when enabled, it should be less
     likely to have unintended side affects.
Cygwin:
   - Performance optimization for user's with many projects.
Installer:
   - The installer will now properly shutdown eclimd instances
     registered using the old non-json format.
Docs:
   - Expanded the developer docs (development-index) to include docs
     on creating new commands (development-commands) along with some
     of the basics for adding new eclim plugins (development-plugins).

2.2.6 / 1.7.14 (May 18, 2013)
=============================

Bug Fixes:
   - Fixed eclimd to prevent incorrect addition of -d32 on 64bit
     systems, which prevents eclimd from starting.
   - Fix potential conflicts between syntastic validation vs eclim
     validation (syntastic validation will be diabled if eclim
     validation is available for the current file type).
   - Many more fixes.
Android:
   - Updated for ADT 22.0.0
C/C++:
   - |:CCallHierarchy| now support showing callee tree.
Java:
   - |:JavaImpl| now supports anonymous inner classes and will also
     properly handle suggesting methods from a nested superclass.
Php:
   - Eclim will no longer run php files through html validation by
     default (see the Php Validation (vim-php-validate) doc for
     settings to enable html validation).
Scala:
   - Scala support updated for Scala IDE 3.0.0.
   - Scala now supported on both versions of eclim (Juno and
     Indigo).

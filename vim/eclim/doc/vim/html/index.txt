Html
====


Code Completion
---------------

Html code completion uses the standard Vim code completion mechanism
(vim-code_completion) like so:

>

   <ht<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <he<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <lin<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <link ty<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <link type
   ...

<



File Validation
---------------

When editing a html file eclim will default to validating the file
when it is written. Any errors will be added to the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line
number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

If you do not want your html files validated automatically when saved,
you can set the |g:EclimHtmlValidate| variable described in the
configuration section below.

*:Validate_html*

Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes
the command :Validate to manually execute the validation of the file.


Utils
-----

When editing html files eclim provides some utilility commands for
your convience.

*:BrowserOpen*

:BrowserOpen - Opens the current html file in your configured browser.


Configuration
-------------

Vim Settings (vim-settings)

*g:EclimHtmlValidate*

- g:EclimHtmlValidate (Default: 1) - If set to 0, disables
  validation when saving the file.
  Note: When enabled, syntastic
    (https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) is disabled so that
    eclim and syntastic don't step on each other. If you'd like to use
    syntastic over eclim for validation, then simply disable eclim's
    validation.If you'd like to disable eclim's source code validation
    for all languages, eclim provides a global variable for that as
    well:>

       let g:EclimFileTypeValidate = 0

    <


- g:EclimValidateSortResults (Default: 'occurrence') - If set to
  'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)

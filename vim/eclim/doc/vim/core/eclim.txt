Vim Settings (vim-settings)

The following is a list of some of the common Vim variables available.

*g:EclimLogLevel*

- g:EclimLogLevel (Default: 'info')
  This variable allows you to control the level of output from eclim
  as follows:

  - 'trace' - Show all trace, debug, info, warning, and error
    messages.
  - 'debug' - Show all debug, info, warning, and error messages.
  - 'info' - Show all info, warning, and error messages.
  - 'warning' - Show only warning, and error messages.
  - 'error' - Show only error messages.
  - 'off' - Don't display any messages.
  Each level also has a corresponding variable to set the highlighting
  group used for the text.

  *g:EclimHighlightError*
  - g:EclimHighlightError (Default: "Error")
  *g:EclimHighlightWarning*
  - g:EclimHighlightWarning (Default: "WarningMsg")
  *g:EclimHighlightInfo*
  - g:EclimHighlightInfo (Default: "Statement")
  *g:EclimHighlightDebug*
  - g:EclimHighlightDebug (Default: "Normal")
  *g:EclimHighlightTrace*
  - g:EclimHighlightTrace (Default: "Normal")
*g:EclimSignLevel*

- g:EclimSignLevel (Default: 'info')
  Behaves just like g:EclimLogLevel except this applies to placing of
  Vim signs for displaying validation errors / warnings, or marking
  quickfix/location list entries.

  The resulting signs also use the same highlighting variables above.

*g:EclimBrowser*

- g:EclimBrowser (Default: Dependent on OS)
  Configures the external web browser to use when opening urls. By
  default eclim will attempt to set a default browser based on your
  system, but if it cannot find a compatible browser, you will need to
  set one in your vimrc.

     - Firefox let g:EclimBrowser = 'firefox'
     - Mozilla let g:EclimBrowser = 'mozilla'
     - Opera let g:EclimBrowser = 'opera'
     - IE let g:EclimBrowser = 'iexplore'
  Note: The above examples assume that the browser executable is in
  your path. On windows machines they won't be by default, so you will
  need to add them.

*g:EclimShowCurrentError*

- g:EclimShowCurrentError (Default: 1)
  This variable determines whether or not a CursorHold autocommand is
  created that will echo the error associated with the current line if
  any error exists.  Setting this variable to 0 disables this feature.

*g:EclimMakeLCD*

- g:EclimMakeLCD (Default: 1)
  When set to a non-0 value, all eclim based make commands (:Ant,
  :Maven, :Mvn, etc) will change to the current file's project root
  before executing.

  Enabling this has the benefit of allowing you to run these commands
  from any file regardless of where it was opened from without having
  to worry about the directory it is executing from.  For example if
  you have a file open from project A and split a file from project B,
  you can execute :Ant from the project B file and it will utilize
  project B's build.xml even though your current working directory is
  in project A.

*g:EclimMenus*

- g:EclimMenus (Default: 1)
  When set to a non-0 value, enabled auto generation of gvim menus
  (under Plugin.eclim) for each eclim command available for the
  current buffer.

*g:EclimPromptListStartIndex*

- ** g:EclimPromptListStartIndex (Default: 0)
  Defines whether to use 0 or 1 based indexing when the user is
  prompted to choose from a list of choices.

Locate File
***********

Eclim provides the :LocateFile command to allow you to quickly find
and open files or buffers.

- :LocateFile [file_pattern] - Attempts to locate the supplied file
  pattern or if no argument is supplied, opens a temporary window
  where the text you type is turned into a pattern and search results
  are presented as you type.

  While in this completion mode the following key bindings are
  available:
     - <esc> - close the search window without selecting a file
     - <tab> or <down> - cycle forward through the results
     - <shift><tab> or <up> - cycle backwards through the results
     - <enter> - open the selected file using the default action
     - <ctrl>e - open the selected file via :edit
     - <ctrl>s - open the selected file via :split
     - <ctrl>t - open the selected file via :tabnew
     - <ctrl>l - switch the locate scope
     - <ctrl>h - toggle the help buffer
  By default, the search string accepted by the completion mode is
  intended to be just portions of the file name you are looking for,
  which is then automatically expanded in an effort to help you find
  the file with the fewest keystrokes possible.

  The argument version of :LocateFile on the other hand, accepts a
  hybrid glob/regex pattern.  The glob portion allows you to use * and
  ** to match portions of a path or traverse multiple directories.
  You can mix * and ** with standard perl compatible regex operators
  to construct your search pattern.

  If you prefer the more explicit patterns supported by the argument
  version of :LocateFile over the default "fuzzy" pattern supported by
  the completion version of :LocateFile, then you can turn off the
  fuzzy matching support using the g:EclimLocateFileFuzzy variable
  described below.

  By default, all searching by both variants of this command is
  limited to the current project and any projects listed as
  dependencies, but you can widen the search scope to include all open
  projects by setting g:EclimLocateFileScope to 'workspace', which is
  the default scope when :LocateFile is executed outside of a project.

  In addition to the 'project' and 'workspace' scopes, :LocateFile
  also supports the following scopes:

  - buffers: search listed buffers
  - quickfix: search the quickfix results
  Note: For performance reasons, locating files in the 'project' and
    'workspace' scopes depends on eclipse being aware of all your
    project files.  For the most part this is handled automatically as
    you create and edit files within vim.  However, actions you take
    outside of vim or eclipse (moving/removing files, updates from a
    version control system, etc.) will not be visible until you force
    a project refresh via |:ProjectRefresh|.

  Note: If you would like to use :LocateFile even when eclimd is not
    running or for projects not known to eclim, one option would be to
    install the silver searcher
    (https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), then install my
    ag plugin (https://github.com/ervandew/ag), and configure eclim to
    use the plugin as the fallback default:>

       let g:EclimLocateFileNonProjectScope = 'ag'

    <


  Configuration

  Vim Settings (vim-settings)

  *g:EclimLocateFileDefaultAction*
  - g:EclimLocateFileDefaultAction (Default: 'split') - Determines
    the command used to open the file when hitting <enter> on an entry
    in the locate file results.
  *g:EclimLocateFileScope*
  - g:EclimLocateFileScope (Default: 'project') - Determines the
    scope for which to search for files.
    - 'project': search only the current project and its
      dependencies.
    - 'workspace': search the entire workspace (all open projects).
    - 'buffers': search listed buffers
    - 'quickfix': search the quickfix results
    - 'vcsmodified': search files reported by your vcs as modified
      or untracked.
  *g:EclimLocateFileFuzzy*
  - g:EclimLocateFileFuzzy (Default: 1) - Determines whether or not
    'fuzzy' searching will be used on the no argument version of
    :LocateFile.
  *g:EclimLocateFileCaseInsensitive*
  - g:EclimLocateFileCaseInsensitive (Default: 'lower') - Determines
    when case insensitive searching is performed.
    - 'lower': when the search string is all lower case the search
      will be case insensitive, but if one or more capital letters are
      present, then the search will be case sensitive.
    - 'always': searching will always be case insensitive.
    - 'never': searching will never be case insensitive.
  Note: Search Filters: eclim does not yet expose the ability to add
    filters should you want to ignore certain directories, but you can
    configure this ability from within Eclipse:<right click on your
    project> ‣ Properties ‣ Resource ‣ Resource Filters

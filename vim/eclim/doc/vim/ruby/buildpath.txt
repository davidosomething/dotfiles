Ruby Interpreters / Build Path

*:RubyInterpreterAdd* *:RubyInterpreterRemove* *:RubyInterpreterList*


Interpreters
============

When creating your first ruby project you will be prompted to
configure a new interpreter if you haven't already done so in eclipse.
You can also manually manage your ruby interpreters with the following
commands:

- :RubyInterpreterAdd [-n <name>] <path> - Add a ruby interpreter.
- :RubyInterpreterRemove <path> - Remove a ruby interpreter.
- :RubyInterpreterList  - List the available ruby interpreters.
If you have more than one interpreter configured when you create
subsequent projects you will be prompted to choose the interpreter to
use. If you remove an interpreter used by one of your projects, you'll
have to go back to that project and edit its .buildpath file and
change the interpreter name in the container entry.

Example (wrapped for readability): Changing ruby1.9 to ruby1.8:

>

   <buildpathentry kind="con"
       path="org.eclipse.dltk.launching.INTERPRETER_CONTAINER/
             org.eclipse.dltk.internal.debug.ui.launcher.GenericRubyInstallType/ruby1.9"/>

<


>

   <buildpathentry kind="con"
       path="org.eclipse.dltk.launching.INTERPRETER_CONTAINER/
             org.eclipse.dltk.internal.debug.ui.launcher.GenericRubyInstallType/ruby1.8"/>

<


If there is no suffix on the container entry, that project will be
using what ever is he default interpreter:

>

   <buildpathentry kind="con"
       path="org.eclipse.dltk.launching.INTERPRETER_CONTAINER"/>

Build Path
==========

Source code completion, searching, and other features make use of the
eclipse dltk's (http://eclipse.org/dltk/) .buildpath to locate
resources. When you first create a dltk project (currently php
(vim-php-index) or ruby (vim-ruby-index)), a .buildpath file is
created in the project's root directory.  If your project depends on
any source files located outside your project or in another project,
then you'll need to edit your .buildpath accordingly.

To help you do this, eclim provides several commands to ease the
creation of new build path entries and variables, all of which are
made available when you edit your .buildpath file in vim.  Also when
you write the .buildpath file, Vim will issue a command to the eclim
server to update the project's build path, and will report any errors
via vim's location list (:help location-list).

The following is a list of commands that eclim provides while editing
your .buildpath.

*:NewSrcEntry_dltk_ruby*

- :NewSrcEntry <dir> [<dir> ...] - Adds one or more new entries
  which reference source directories in your project.
  >
     <buildpathentry external="true" kind="lib" path="src/php"/>

  <

  This command supports command completion of project relative
  directories.

*:NewLibEntry_dltk_ruby*

- :NewLibEntry <dir> [<dir> ...] - Adds one or more new entries
  which reference external source directories.
  >
     <buildpathentry external="true" kind="lib" path="/usr/local/php/cake_1.1.16.5421"/>

  <

  This command supports command completion of directories.

*:NewProjectEntry_dltk_ruby*

- :NewProjectEntry <project> [<project> ...] - Adds one or more new
  entries which reference other projects.
  >
     <buildpathentry combineaccessrules="false" kind="prj" path="/test_project"/>

  <

  This command supports command completion of project names.

Python Validation
*****************

When editing a python file eclim will default to validating the file
when it is written. Any errors will be added to the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line
number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

If you don't want python files validated when saving them, you can set
the g:EclimPythonValidate variable described in the configuration
section below.

*:Validate_python*

Regardless of whether you have validation enabled upon saving or not,
the command :Validate is available to manual validate the file.


Configuration
=============

Vim Settings (vim-settings)

*g:EclimPythonValidate*

- g:EclimPythonValidate (Default 1) - If set to 0, disables python
  validation when saving the file.
  Note: When enabled, syntastic
    (https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) is disabled so that
    eclim and syntastic don't step on each other. If you'd like to use
    syntastic over eclim for validation, then simply disable eclim's
    validation.If you'd like to disable eclim's source code validation
    for all languages, eclim provides a global variable for that as
    well:>

       let g:EclimFileTypeValidate = 0

    <


- g:EclimValidateSortResults (Default: 'occurrence') - If set to
  'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)

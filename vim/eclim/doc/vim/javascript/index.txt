Javascript
**********


Validation
==========

When editing a javascript file eclim will default to validating the
file when it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current
window's location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding
line number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

Javascript validation currently uses JavaScript Lint
(http://www.javascriptlint.com/) to perform the validation.  To use it
you will need to first install JavaScript Lint and put it in your
path.

Installing on windows and the mac should be very straight forward
since pre-compiled version for each are available for download on the
JavaScript Lint (http://www.javascriptlint.com/) site.  For other unix
based systems (linux, bsd, etc.) the installation procedure is not so
obvious.  Here are the steps used to compile and install it on a linux
machine (your paths may vary):

>

   $ cd jsl-<version>/src
   $ make -f Makefile.ref

   # this path will undoubtedly vary on non-linux machines, so watch the
   # make output for the real destination.
   $ sudo cp Linux_All_DBG.OBJ/jsl /usr/local/bin

If you don't want javascript files validated when saving them, you can
set the g:EclimJavascriptValidate variable described in the
configuration section below.

*:Validate_javascript*

Regardless of whether you have validation enabled upon saving or not,
the command :Validate is available to manually execute the validation.


Configuration
=============

*g:EclimJavascriptValidate*

- g:EclimJavascriptValidate (Default: 1) - If set to 0, disables

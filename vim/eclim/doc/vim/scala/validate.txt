Scala Validation
****************

When saving a scala source file that resides in a project, eclim will
update that source file in Eclipse and will report any validation
errors found. Any errors will be placed in the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and the corresponding lines in the
source file will be marked via Vim's :sign functionality with '>>'
markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of scala source files can be disabled via the
g:EclimScalaValidate variable (described below). If you choose to
disable automatic validation, you can still use the :Validate command
to manually validate the current file.


Configuration
=============

Vim Settings (vim-settings)

*g:EclimScalaValidate*

- g:EclimScalaValidate (Default: 1) - If set to 0, disables source
  code validation.
- g:EclimValidateSortResults (Default: 'occurrence') - If set to
  'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)

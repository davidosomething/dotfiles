Java Refactoring
****************

*:JavaRename*


Rename
======

The first refactoring that eclim supports is :JavaRename, which can be
used to rename various java elements.

Example:

>

   package org.foo.bar;

   public class Foo {
     public void bar(){
     }
   }

<


To rename the class from 'Foo' to 'Bar' you simply position the cursor
over the class name 'Foo' and execute:

>

   :JavaRename Bar

<


The result of which will the following prompt:

>

   Rename "Foo" to "Bar"
   ([e]xecute / [p]review / [c]ancel):

<


This prompt give you three options:

1. execute: Execute the refactoring without previewing the changes
   to be made. The current file and any other changed files open in
   the current instance of vim will be reloaded.
2. preview: Preview the changes that the refactoring will perform.
   This will open a scratch buffer with a list of changes to be made
   along with a link at the bottom to execute the refactoring.
   The contents of the preview window will vary depending on what you
   are renaming.

   If we are renaming 'Foo' to 'Bar' the contents would be like so:

   >
       other: Rename compilation unit 'Foo.java' to 'Bar.java'

      |Execute Refactoring|

   <

   If we are renaming the method 'bar' to 'foo', the contents would
   look like so:

   >
      |diff|: /home/someuser/workspace/test_java/src/org/foo/bar/Foo.java

      |Execute Refactoring|

   <

   If the first instance, there is not much to preview.  Since this
   particular class is not referenced anywhere else, the only
   operation eclipse will perform, is to rename the file from
   'Foo.java' to 'Bar.java' which will also update the class name in
   that file.

   In the second instance eclipse provides a preview of the actual
   changes to the file what will be performed.  If the method were
   referenced elsewhere, you would see an entry for each file that
   would be modified by the refactoring.  To actually for a vim diff
   split of the changes that will be performed, simple position the
   cursor on the diff entry and hit <enter>.

   Once you are satisfied with changes that eclipse will perform, you
   can then execute the refactoring by positioning the cursor over the
   "|Execute Refactoring|" link and hit <enter>.

3. cancel: Cancel the refactoring (Hitting enter without typing a
   choice or hitting Ctrl-C will also cancel the refactoring).
Package Renaming

Renaming a package is performed just like renaming any other element.
However, the name you supply to the :JavaRename command must be the
full package name that you are renaming the package to.  For example.
In sample java file above, if you place the cursor on the 'org'
portion of the package declaration, you can rename 'org' to 'com' by
running :JavaRename com.  If you want to rename the 'foo' package to
'baz' you can do so by running :JavaRename org.baz.  Note that if you
were to only supply the name 'baz', the 'foo' package would be moved
to the same level as 'org' and then renamed.

Warning: When renaming a package, the associated directory will also
  be renamed in the underlying file system.  Eclim will do its best to
  reload any files that have moved as a result of the directory
  renaming and adjust your current working directory if necessary, but
  only for the current vim session.  If you have other vim sessions
  open with files located in the directory that is renamed, then eclim
  will be unable to reload those files in those sessions for you, so
  you will have to do so manually.  A best practice would be to close
  any other vim sessions that might be affected by the renaming of a
  package.

*:JavaMove*


Move
====

Eclim also supports moving a top level class or interface from one
package to another using the :JavaMove command.

In this example the current file would be moved from its current
package to the package org.foo:

>

   :JavaMove org.foo

<


Like the package renaming described in the previous section, the
argument to :JavaMove must be the full package name you want to move
the current file to.


Refactor Undo/Redo
==================

In the event that you need to undo a refactoring, eclim provides the
:RefactorUndo command. When executed, the last refactoring will be
reverted. If you are unsure what the last refactoring was, the
:RefactorUndoPeek command will print the name of the top most
refactoring on the undo stack.

Eclim also provides the :RefactorRedo and :RefactorRedoPeek commands
which provide the redo counterpart to the undo commands.


Configuration
=============

Vim Settings (vim-settings)

*g:EclimRefactorDiffOrientation_java*

- g:EclimRefactorDiffOrientation (Default: 'vertical') - Specifies
  the orientation used when previewing a refactoring and performing a
  diff split between the current file contents and the changes to be
  performed by the refactoring.  Possible values include 'vertical' or
  'horizontal'.

Java Validation / Correction
****************************


Validation
==========

When saving a java source file that resides in a project, eclim will
update that source file in Eclipse and will report any validation
errors found.  Any errors will be placed in the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and the corresponding lines in the
source file will be marked via Vim's :sign functionality with '>>'
markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of java source files can be disabled via the
g:EclimJavaValidate variable (described below).  If you choose to
disable automatic validation, you can still use the :Validate command
to manually validate the current file.


Configuration
-------------

Vim Settings (vim-settings)

*g:EclimJavaValidate*

- g:EclimJavaValidate (Default: 1) - If set to 0, disables source
  code validation.
  Note: When enabled, syntastic
    (https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) is disabled so that
    eclim and syntastic don't step on each other. If you'd like to use
    syntastic over eclim for validation, then simply disable eclim's
    validation.If you'd like to disable eclim's source code validation
    for all languages, eclim provides a global variable for that as
    well:>

       let g:EclimFileTypeValidate = 0

    <


- g:EclimValidateSortResults (Default: 'occurrence') - If set to
  'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)
Eclim settings

*org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.source*

- org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.source - Determines the target java
  vm version (1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5).
*:JavaCorrect*


Code Correction
===============

Code correction in eclim is equivalent to the quick fix functionality
of Eclipse. When you save a java source file, eclim validates () the
file and notes which lines contain errors. To have eclim suggest
possible corrections for an error, you simply place the cursor on the
error line and issue :JavaCorrect.

The result will be a small window opened at the bottom of Vim where
any correction proposals will be noted. To apply a suggested change,
simply move the cursor to the line describing the modification and hit
<enter>. Upon doing so, the change will be applied to the source file.

Example output of :JavaCorrect.

>

   The serializable class Foo does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field of type long
   0.1227:  Add @SuppressWarnings 'serial' to 'Foo'
     ...
     @SuppressWarnings("serial")
     public class Foo
     implements Serializable
   ...

<


To apply the above change you would hit <enter> on the line:

>

   0.1227:  Add @SuppressWarnings 'serial' to 'Foo'

<


Note: Java code corrections are handled just like a refactoring
  (vim-java-refactor) so the RefactorUndo (|:RefactorUndo|) and
  RefactorRedo (|:RefactorRedo|) commands can be used to undo/redo
  corrections that can't be handled by vim's undo (like file moves).

*:Checkstyle*


Checkstyle
==========

When editing a java source file, eclim provides the command
:Checkstyle which will invoke checkstyle
(http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) on the current file.

Additionally, you can configure eclim to execute checkstyle
automatically when you save a java source file by setting the eclim
project settings org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate to true.

Please note that both methods of invoking checkstyle require that you
first configure the location of your checkstyle config file using the
eclim setting org.eclim.java.checkstyle.config, described in the
configuration section below.


Configuration
-------------

Eclim Settings (vim-settings)

*org.eclim.java.checkstyle.config*

- org.eclim.java.checkstyle.config - Defines the location (project
  relative or absolute) or your checkstyle config file.
*org.eclim.java.checkstyle.properties*

- org.eclim.java.checkstyle.properties - Defines the location
  (project relative or absolute) or your checkstyle properties file.
*org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate*

- org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate - When set to true,
  checkstyle will be run on the file along with the regular java
  validation upon writing the file.

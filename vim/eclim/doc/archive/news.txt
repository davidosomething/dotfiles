Please note that the Scala IDE (http://scala-ide.org) , which eclim
uses to provide scala support, is not yet available for Eclipse 4.2

Juno.

Warning: Non vim users (emacs-eclim, subclim, etc.): The underlying
  command response format for eclim has changed, which means that any
  project relying on the old format isn't going to work. So if you are
  installing eclim for use with a client other than vim, then be sure
  to check with the client project to see if it has been updated for
  eclim 1.7.3 or later.

from this release and will hopefully return soon after the pdt team
release a Ganymede (3.4) compatible version.

2005-09-11
==========

Several new additions over the past couple weeks:

- Java code completion: Integrated into Vim via Vim 7's new "User
  Defined Completion".
- Added eclim command line support for creating and updating
  projects, including Vim support for editing Eclipse .classpath files
  and updating Eclipse upon writing of those files.
- Integrated nailgun (http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/) to
  greatly improve the command line client performance.
- Started documenting eclim and its features.
With the addition of these features I'm going to stop adding new
functionality for the time being and focus on testing and ensuring
that everything works as expected on Windows.


2005-08-21
==========

Code navigation / searching is done!  Most of the Vim integration for
searching is done as well.  The only thing missing is viewing code for
results that are found in a jar file that have no corresponding source
attachment.  I may end up doing what Eclipse appears to do, which is
to use javap to display the class and method signatures.  That or I'll
use jad to decompile the whole source.  My only issue with jad, is
that it is not up to date with the 1.5 byte code.

I also have automated importing done as well.  The eclim server
request just returns a list of possible results to import for a given
request and the editor (Vim in this case) handles prompting the user
and updating the code.

Note: The Vim integration now requires Vim 7.  Even though Vim 7 is
  still alpha, I haven't had any major issues with it and the new
  additions to the Vim scripting language are just too good to pass
  up.

My next step is to start documenting everything and testing on a
Windows environment to ensure there aren't any compatibility issues.

After that I should be ready to put out a preliminary release. I'm
trying to be very careful about releasing anything too soon.  The last
thing I want it to scare anyone off with a broken project that doesn't
seem to work properly.


2005-08-11
==========

Sourceforge site is up!  Now it's just a matter of getting the ball
rolling again.

I'm hoping to have source code navigation working by the end of next
week. This includes the ability to simply hit <enter> on a class name,
method name, method call, etc. to jump to its declaration.  Basically
I want to replace my previous Vim plug-in
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1106) with the new
Eclipse one.

Before I put out any releases though, I want to have a comprehensive
set of documentation.  For the first few releases, setup will probably
be pretty manual, with most of it occurring through the Eclipse
interface.  Going forward, I want to move more of that functionality
into Vim.

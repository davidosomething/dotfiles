# macOS/OS X

User data on encrypted volumes other than the boot volume will not mount until
login. To remedy this, see [Unlock] (forked to my GitHub for archival).

## Disable some keyboard shortcuts

Remove these using System Preferences:

- `Mission Control` owns <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>→</kbd>
- `Spotlight` owns <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>space</kbd>

## Reduce desktop icon size

Click desktop to focus Finder, <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>j</kbd> use smallest sizes for
everything.

## App store

1. iCloud sign in
1. Install App store apps

    - [Display Menu] or EasyRes: Set higher/native resolutions
    - [Xcode]: select CLI tools in prefs
        - This is __required__ to build some apps like neovim@HEAD

## Setup ssh keys

1. `sshkeygen` (alias to generate new ed25519 keys)
1. Add the public key to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
1. `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/privatekeyfile` to store the key in Keychain.

## Install dotfiles

```sh
git clone https://github.com/davidosomething/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles/
```

## Install homebrew and bootstrap

Install homebrew according to <https://brew.sh/>.

Mojave no longer installs SDK headers for building certain things. It comes
with mac OS but requires manual execution. Use
[bootstrap/mac](../bootstrap/mac) to install it:

```sh
~/.dotfiles/bootstrap/mac
```

The script will also:

- `brew bundle` some default packages
- Run the fzf installer
- Change the user's default shell to the brewed `zsh`

Bundle dumps for specific systems are in my `~/.secret` (not public).

## Cask notes

- dropbox
    - Has app settings sync so wait for it to finish syncing.
    - If the shared directory is on an external volume, disable autostart and
      add [LoginItems/DelayedDropbox.app](LoginItems/DelayedDropbox.app) to
      your login items instead. It is a generic app made using Script Editor.
- bettertouchtool
    - License in gmail
    - Provides better trackpad swipe configs, drag window snapping,
      modifier-hold window resizing
    - Synced to Dropbox
- hammerspoon
    - App launcher (<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>space</kbd>) to replace spotlight
      (disable spotlight shortcut first)
    - Audio output device switch in menubar, relies on `switchaudio-osx` which
      is in homebrew
    - Auto-type from clipboard (<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>v</kbd>) for
      paste blockers
    - Caffeinate in menubar
    - Window management keys to use sections of a monitor (try hitting the key
      multiple times) and to throw apps to the next monitor
      (<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>f/h/l/z/[/]</kbd>)

## mackup

`mackup` backs up application settings. It will be installed if using this
repo's Brewfile.

`dot.mackup.cfg` defines some app settings (such as the itsycal plist). It is
symlinked to `~/.mackup.cfg` by `bootstrap/symlink`.

Mackup is configured to use `~/.local/Mackup` as the storage location. On my
system this is a symlink to a private settings repository.

Run `mackup restore` to restore settings from that repository.

## Install development tools

Installed packages before development tools. After you start using `pyenv` it
gets annoying to remember to switch back to system python for each `brew`
operation. Use the `bi` alias for a clean room install if possible.

- Increase file limits a la
  <https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/1979#issuecomment-260790451>
    - See <https://gist.github.com/abernix/a7619b07b687bb97ab573b0dc30928a0>
      if there are still file limit issues
    - REBOOT for `ulimit -n` changes to take effect
- Install asdf or [fnm] using [bootstrap/fnm](../bootstrap/fnm) and install
  a version of `node` (and `npm`)
- Install asdf or [pyenv] using `pyenv-installer` (rm `~/.local/pyenv`
  directory for clean install) and make sure to use the libs provided by brew.
  See the packages marked "for pyenv" in the [Brewfile](./Brewfile)
  1. Install the latest python using using
     [bootstrap/pyenv](../bootstrap/pyenv). This will also create a `neovim3`
     virtualenv.
  1. Set up the global pyenv as the latest stable (3.x). Check ansible
     compatibility first if it's needed (e.g. ansible is not 3.8.x ready).
